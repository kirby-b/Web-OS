          Kirby-b was born at a very young age to loving parents. At the age of 15 he discovered his love for programming and technology as a whole. Since then he has devoted
          his life to trying to make useful stuff and making beautiful garbage instead. This programmers one weakness is his interest in all branches of technology and his 
          constant want for new concepts. This may sound good, but it leaves him staying up all night going on research sprees and starting too many projects to ever finish.

          <img src="python.png" alt="python logo" style="float:left; width:6rem; height:6rem; margin: 1rem;">
          The first program he made was with python due to its ease of use and simple syntax, and naturally he has stayed using python for a great majority of his coding adventures.
          Soon after learning how python works, he took a class at his local career center and discovered the language of Java. During this time he learned many things, mainly how 
          much he loves coffee(ironic isn't it) and the finer parts of OOP.

          <img src="Godot_icon.png" alt="godot icon" style="float:right; width:6rem; height:6rem; margin: 1rem;">
          As a senior he worked on a website for a national competition and valiantly fought off the god complex that developed every time he fixed bugs. Once he was done building 
          the website and competing he realized he didnt know what to do next. His teacher recommended he learn game developement, so he started learning godot and finished the year 
          working on his platformer game.

          He currently is working on learning data science and game development, a journey he realizes will take many hours of brute forcing his into making the beep boop machine in 
          front of him do tasks that sound much simpler on paper. He hopes all of the skills he learns with some day pay off and he can be come successful in the industry he loves
          so much.
